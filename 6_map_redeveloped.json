It wasn’t long before the group realised that the plight of Dublin’s sick dogs and cats desperately needed to be addressed. The solution came when the first Irish Blue Cross mobile clinic hit Dublin’s streets in 1953, prioritising it’s presence in areas where there was highest demand for charitable veterinary services.<br><br>In 2009, our small animal clinic was established with state of the art facilities at our base in Inchicore, Dublin 8.  The opening of that clinic, complemented by our mobile clinics, has made an immeasurable difference to so many communities across Dublin and without our support, many families would struggle with providing necessary care and assistance for their pets.  Today, our clinic services have expanded to ten locations across Dublin each week day evening, locations such as Cabra, Tallaght, Blanchardstown, Crumlin, Ballyfermot, Ballybrack, Smithfield, Walkinstown, Finglas and Whitehall.  Where pets require more comprehensive clinical examinations and treatments, they are referred to our Inchicore clinic.",

Significant professional performance opportunities accompany these awards as a result of RDS negotiated partnerships with the National Symphony Orchestra, the RTÉ Concert Orchestra, the Centre Culturel Irlandais in Paris and the Blackwater Valley Opera Festival.<br>We partnered with the RTÉ Concert Orchestra to organise a special performance/recording event in early 2022, to facilitate the pandemic-related backlog of performance opportunities for former winners of the RDS Music Bursary Programme.  The concert was recorded for broadcast on RTÉ lyric FM and introduced by Liz Nolan. Each soloist received professionally engineered recordings of their performances.<br>The RDS Arts Programme dispersed a total prize fund of €127,000 in 2022 across its three main programmes in craft, visual art, and classical music. The Feis Ceoil Association also receives significant annual support from the RDS (€70k) through the Arts Programme budget.",

The prize fund of 1.25 million euro attracted strong entry numbers and provided top class national and international competition for the 147th edition of the event.  Ireland’s victory in the Nations’ Cup for the Aga Khan Trophy was the crowning moment, made more special with two Irish bred horses on the Team for the first time in 15 years - Shane Sweetnam’s ‘James Kann Cruz’ and Cian O’Connor’s ‘Kilkenny’. The benefits of the horse / human relationship became the theme for the Show, and the positive impact it can have on society was showcased through a new ‘Positive Strides’ programme, which promoted several organisations in the area of equine therapy and equine assisted learning.  It is the mix of best-in-class equestrian competition, entertainment, shopping, the ability to incorporate themes of societal relevance, and the social occasion that makes the Show the truly unique event that it is.",

The three panel discussions in the 2022 programme covered important issues such as how to finance the transition to a more sustainable economy, the importance of investing in research, and the potential of Ireland to be a leader in renewable energy production.<br>In addition to the video archive that has been created through the RDS YouTube channel the Enterprise programme launched a new podcast channel in 2022.

After the 2021 programme, over 35,000 students have now participated to-date. Mirroring ESB Science Blast in 2022 was the RDS STEM Learning programme, which pivoted to a new Teacher CPD course, run in association with Marino Institute of Education. The course, a mixture of STEM investigation skills, literacy and number skills, and enquiry-based learning, quickly became one of the highest attended courses run by Marino in 2022. <br>Despite the 2022 ESB Science Blast programme once again being impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the delay in lifting of public health restrictions, and the subsequent disruption to the school year, 2022 was one of the most successful years of the programme! As the programme remained online again for 2022, over 440 projects participated - leading to an in-class showcase where the whole school community could become involved. The programme involved 280 judges, working in-class or remotely to give the children a real sense of achievement in their projects. The programme also once again fulfilled its all-island goal - with 31 countries getting involved in STEM. Additionally, ESB Science Blast went on the road, bringing a taste of the fun and excitement of our live events to schools around the country as part of the Promotional Roadshow. Complementing the hard work of the teachers and students was an expanded resource library, assisting both groups to fully maximise their project potential. As the RDS plans the return of ESB Science Blast live events for 2023, the programme is ready to blast off again!",
